## Introduction

Customer segmentation is the process of categorizing a customer base into distinct groups with similar characteristics, behaviors, or preferences. This approach helps businesses create targeted marketing campaigns and enhance customer satisfaction.

In this repository, we provide a comprehensive guide in multiple phases for performing customer segmentation using data science techniques.

## Phases

### Phase 1 - [Document 1: ADS_Phase1]
 
### Phase 2 - [Document 2: ADS_Phase2]

### Phase 3 - [Document 3: ADS_Phase3]

### Phase 4 - [Document 4: ADS_Phase4]

### Phase 5 - [Document 5: ADS_Phase5]

## Dependencies

To replicate the customer segmentation process and run the code mentioned in the documents, you may need the following dependencies:

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Scikit-Learn
- Matplotlib
- Sklearn

You can install most of these dependencies using `pip`:

Shell

pip install pandas
pip install numpy
pip install scikit-learn
pip install matplotlib
pip install jupyter
pip install sklearn

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

Shell

git clone https://github.com/pugazh4/customer_segmentation.git

2. Navigate to the respective phase directory using the command line:

Shell

cd phaseX

Replace `X` with the desired phase number (e.g., `phase1`, `phase2`, etc.).

3. Follow the instructions provided in the documents to perform the specific phase of customer segmentation.

4. Modify and adapt the code and processes as needed for your project.
